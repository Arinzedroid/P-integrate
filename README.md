# P-integrate

This is a demo app that guides Android developers on how to integrate several popular payment platforms into their apps.


## Supported payment platforms
 
 - <a href="#jumpone">Paystack</a>
 - <a href="google.com">Google Pay</a>
 - <a href="google.com">GT-Pay</a>
 
With the help of awesome developers like you, we hope to expand our database of supported payment platforms.


## Usage
Simply clone this repository and follow the code guides. Emphasis was put in making sure the code was well commented.


# <div id="jumpone">Paystack

<a href="http://paystack.com"><i>Official documentation</i></a><br />
Before you proceed to do anything, make sure you have the following set up:

<ul>
 <li>Create an account on http://paystack.com, complete the registration, create a new project and generate your public key.</li>
 <li>Add the line: <b>implementation 'co.paystack.android:paystack:3.0.10'</b> to your app-level gradle dependency.</li>
 <li>Add the line: <b><uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /></b> to your manifest.</li>
 
 </ul>
 </div>
